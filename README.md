# DungeonMaster-AI
About the Project: 
Dungeon Master AI (DMAI) is a custom fine-tuned GPT-2 Medium language model, designed to run dynamic, semi-autonomous Dungeons & Dragons-inspired storytelling campaigns. The AI acts as the Dungeon Master (DM), describing environments, interpreting dice rolls, generating combat outcomes, and evolving narrative scenes based on player choices.

Built With: 
Python 3.11, PyTorch, Huggingface Transformers, Google Colab / CSUSB HPC Access, GPT-2 Medium (Fine-tuned model).

Future Goals: 
Teach full D&D stat and armor systems, Dynamic faction reputation tracking, Random encounter generation, Larger model fine-tuning on HPC clusters (TinyMistral, Llama 3 Small).
