# 🧙‍♂️ Dungeon Master AI: Campaign Engine

## 📜 About the Project

Dungeon Master AI (DMAI) is a custom fine-tuned GPT-2 Medium language model designed to run dynamic, semi-autonomous fantasy RPG campaigns.

The AI acts as a Dungeon Master (DM), describing vivid environments, interpreting dice rolls, generating combat outcomes, managing short-term memory of player choices, and evolving narratives dynamically based on player input.

Built for immersive storytelling with D&D-inspired mechanics!
